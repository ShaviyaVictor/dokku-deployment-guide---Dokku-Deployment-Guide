# Dokku environment variables
This guide is for setting environment variables specific to your application. This guide will be helpful for setting variables that our `application.properties` would normaly handle.
## What are environment variables?
Before we can get started on adding environment variables to our application we first need to know what they are. Ultimately environment variables are just variables that you set in your system. These can often be used to make your life easier or hold important system info. A good example of this is if we needed to change our current director to our home directory we could just use the command `cd $HOME` and we would be taken to our home directory. You can find more on environment variables [here](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa#:~:text=An%20environment%20variable%20is%20a,at%20a%20point%20in%20time.)
## SpringBoot environment variables
Typically, in a spring boot project we will have a file in the resources' directory called `application.properties`. Spring boot makes our lives easier by letting our application use this file as our project's environment variables when the file is present, but when we deploy our application does not have a `application.properties`. This means that we will have to set the environment variables in the remote server.
